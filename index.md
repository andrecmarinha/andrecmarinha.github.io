I am a doctoral student based at [NOVA FCSH](https://www.fcsh.unl.pt/), in Lisbon, Portugal and a researcher in [HOME - How Members of Parliament in Africa Represent Their Constituencies](https://project-home.pt/).

My research interests lie on the intersection between the study power, protest and political representation/s, with a focus on Sub-Saharan Africa.

My [research](./research.html) focuses on political violence. In particular, I use a variety of quantitative methods to understand social and political dynamics in the aftermath of violent conflicts. My book project investigates the long-term consequences of civilian victimization and develops a new theory on how and under which circumstances violence leaves persistent legacies. Part of my research has been published at *The Journal of Politics*, the *Journal of Peace Research*, and the *Journal of Conflict Resolution*, among others.
